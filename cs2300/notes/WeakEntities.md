# Weak Entities 
A *Weak Entity* is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified using its own attributes, so it **depends on another entity to be uniquely identified**.

Family cannot be uniquely identified by **Name** alone so it depends on the key of the Employ table.  

Week Entities are drawn like entities but with a dashed boarder, the relationship going to the entity also has a dashed border.
