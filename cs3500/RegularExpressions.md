# Regular Expressions 
Regular Expressions were developed for the *specification problem*, but you still **can't specify a programming language with regular expressions.** 

You can, however, specify *components* of a programming language. 

## Tokens 
A Token, is a category of strings in a language 

Examples: integers, constants, identifiers, decimals, etc...

An instance of a token is a *Lexan.*
